I served as the sole instructor of University of Michigan CEE graduate course "CEE 552: Travel Behavior Analysis and Forecasting" in the 2024 Fall semester, and will continue to teach the course in the 2025 Fall semester. The course comprehensively covers concepts in travel demand modeling (you can check my example schedule below). In Fall 2024, I was fortunate to embark on this journey with an excellent group of students, a diverse cohort from Civil Engineering and Computer Science that included undergraduates, master's students, and PhD students, and received an 4.97/5.0 teaching evaluation score from them. As the course instructor, my responsibilities include:
- Design the course syllabus, including content, schedule, grading and policies
- Design lectures, activities
- Design and create rubrics for homeworks, projects and exams
- Deliver two 80-minute in-person lecture every week
- Administer and grade the homeworks
- Hold weekly office hours
- Administer, give feedback and grade course project
- Administer and grade exams
- Deliver final course grade to the University
